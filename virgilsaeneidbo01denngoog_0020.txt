16 VIRGIL’s AENmD

ished. The fourth Eclogue was misinterpreted, and was believed
to be a prophecy of the approaching birth of Christ. · This,
together with other influences, led to the mediaeval conception
of Virgil as a great magician. Many fantastica} legends were
woven about his name. It was believed that Virgil's name was
derived from virga, ‘a magic wand.’ Thus, in time this came to
be spelled Virgilius, from which the current English form of the
name is descended. As early as the second century the custom
prevailed of inquiring into future events by opening at random a
volume of the poet's workS. These chance· oracles were called
Sortes Vergilianae.

It is said that Virgil, a short time before his death, desired to
burn the manuscript of the Aeneid, because of the imperfect state
in which it would necessarily be left. But being dissuaded from
this purpose by his friends Tucca and Varius, he directed them by
his will to strike out all the verses that were incomplete‚ but to add
nothing. It does not appear, however, that anything was erased
by them, while many passages betray a lack of finish that undoubt-
edly would have been changed and corrected had the poet lived
to make a revision of the whole work.

Thus the Aeneid, like some of the grandest sculptures of
Michael Angelo, was left unfinished, and with some parts, per-
· haps, in the rough. But our interest is even enhanced in the
works of both of these great Italian masters by the very fact that
these unfinished parts show us the hand, as it were, still holding
the chisel, and in the act of creation.

Virgil was an imitator. He borrowed without stint from Homer,
from Apollonius, from the Greek tragedies3 in short, he laid un-
der contribution all the earlier poets both of Greece and of Rome.
Nothing beautiful in them, nothing fitted to his purpose, escaped
his search. But he so appropriated to himself, and assimilated to
his own modes of thought their ideaS‚ images, and forms of ex-
pression, that they come before us in the Aeneid in all the fresh-
ness and individuality of new creations. The Aeneid stands
nearly in the same relation to all prefixisting literature as does
