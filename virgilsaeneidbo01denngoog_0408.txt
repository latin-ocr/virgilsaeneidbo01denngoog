N 56 VIRGIL’S AEN EID

178. onim ni repetant Argius ‘unless they seek the omens again in
Greece.' They had before sailing for Troy taken the omens at Aulis. Virgll
may have in mind the practice of Roman generals, who, under certain cir·
cumstances, went back to Rome to renew the auspices. nument ‘ the favor
of heaven.’

179. quod—avexerat ‘which (says Sinon) they brought away (of old)
upon the sea! The indicative mood shows this statement to be the language
of Sinon, not of Calchas, which would have been quoted indirectly, and be
put therefore in the subjunctive mood.

180. quod potiere—parantz ‘as to the fact that they have sought—(it
is because) they are preparing.' H. 588, 3, N.; LM. 8473 A. 333, ag Β. 299,
23 G. 525, 23 (H. 540, IV, N).

181. Anna, deosz i.e. reenforcements for war and the favor of the gods.

183. monitiz ‘being instructed’3 namely, by Calchas. prox ‘in place of.’
Here Sinon comes to the most delicate part of his story3 he must give a
plausible reason both for the building of the horse and forits vast size, and he
must make such suggestions as shall induce the Trojans to take it into the
city.

184. quae piaret: ‘to atone for.’ See note on 1, 20.

185, 186. The emphasis is on immensam, which should be joined to attol-
lere. They were not only advised to build this in place of the Palladium, but
to build it of vast dimensions‚ so that the Trojans might not get it into the
city to serve as a new Palladium, and that they might be tempted through
-suspicion to lay violent hands upon it, and thus incur the anger of Minerva.

186. Roboribusz ablative expressing the means of attollere. caeloz dative
for ad caelum. See note on Latio, I, 6.

187. portis: the instrumental ablative of way by which. H. 4763 LM.

188. Neu: ‘or lest ’ς = et ne. antiqua sub religione: under the same
religious security as that which they had enjoyed under the Palladium.

189. Nam—violasse& this is the continuation, in the oblique form, of
what Calchas had stated. An idea of saying is implied in the foregoing verb5
iussit (l. 186). For the subjunctive, see note on l. 94

190. omen: i.e. the fate or destruction indicated by the omen. ipsunt
refers to Calchas.

193. Ultro: ‘beyond ’ what you would expect3 i.e. ‘actually‚' ⁶ even.' See
note on 1. 145.

194. nostroot refers to the GreekS. ea fata: ‘such fates,’ namely, as the
exitium in l. 190. This calamity would await the posterity of the Greeks if
the horse should be received into the city by the Trojans.

198. millet a round number. In the Iliad, ΙΙ, 924 sqq„ the number of
the Grecian ships is stated as 1 186.
