24 VIRGIL’S AENEm

A. 348 3 B. 363 fol. 3 G. 707 fol. 3 (H. 579)). Certain mechanicam
devices may then be resorted t0. Take, for instance, the opening
line of the Third Book. The sixth foot, since it is never a dactyl,
must consist of but two syllableS, here, gentem. The fifth foot is
regularly a dactyl, here, vertere. We have now the first four feet to
determine. The first foot is plainly a spondee, since the Post in the
first syllable is necessarily long, and the a in -quam is long by posi-
tion, being followed by m and r (of res). The fourth foot is also
a spondee since the -i, the sign of the genitive case in Priami, is
long, and by elision there remains but one syllable (-que e·)
before the beginning of the fifth foot. This must be, and as
a matter of fact is, long. Of the remaining syllables composing
the second and third feet, the diphthong -ae in Asiae we know is

, long. The only combination possible then is res Asi-‚ and -ae

Pn'a-. We thus learn, without consulting a lexicon, that the four
vowels in Asi· and Pria· are short. In this way the line may be
read without a previous knowledge of root voweIS. The same
method may be applied with like success to many other lines.¹

For an explanation of common terms in Latin prosody often
recurring in the N otes of this book, such as Elision‚ HiatuS,
Caesura, etc., see H. 720 fol. 3 LM. 1109 fol. 3 A. 359 fol. 3 B.
368 fol. 3 G. 718 fol. 3 (H. 596 fol.).

IV. MANUSCRIPTS

The text of Virgil occupies a unique position among the works
of Roman writers in that it was transmitted to us by several very
ancient manuscripts These are seven in number, and they date
from the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. Three are fragmentary,
containing only a few leaveS, while the other four are practically
complete. All are written in the ‘ capital ⁹ script, the oldest form
of writing employed in Latin manuscripts. One of the most valu-
able is known as the Schedae Vaticanae. It begins with the third
book of the Georgics and extends through the eighth book of the
