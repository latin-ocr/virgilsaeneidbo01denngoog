successively! For the tense, see note on l. 31. omnia: is here a dissyllable‚
om·nya. praemissus: ‘ who had been sent sorward,' while Aeneas remained
in front os the temple. From this it would seem that the Sibyl's cave was at
some distance, procul, from the temple of Apollo.

36. Deiphobe: the name here given to the Cumaean Sibyl. Glauci:
⁶(the daughter) of Glaucus? Glaucus was a marine divinity gisted with

sacred grott0, or holy place in the depths of the hill, was probably connected
with the temple of Apollo (aurea tecta, l. 13) by a passage in the rear, and
