see H.613,4; LM. 1019; A. 292,e; Β. 337‚3; G. 5363 (H.535, 4). The Greeks
make an attack on the front of the palace in two divisions. One party,
headed by Pyrrhus, storms the gate‚ under cover of their shields. These they
join together above their headS‚ by lapping one shield over another, like the
tiles or shingles of a roos, forming thus a testudo, under the shelter of which
they are sase from the missiles hurled down upon them by the defenders
(ll. 441 and 469 sqq.). The other party attempts, by scaling ladders‚ to gain
the battlements (11. 442-444).
