nores-Boon v N151

514. Tela: for the singular3 ‘ his shaft.’ The arrow is said to be strained
as well as the bow. See note on l. 507. fratrem: Eurytion invoked the aid
of Pandarus, a deified hero, as Entellus (l. 483) that of Eryx.

521. Ostentanaz the distant flight of the arrow, and the noise of the bow,
would show the strength and skill os old Acestes.

522-524. Hic—vates: ‘hereupon a strange sight, sudden and destined
to be a portent of great presage, meets their eyes. The great event after·
ward explained it, and the awful soothsayers interpreted the omens too late.’
The event which this omen was intended to foreshadow has never been satis·
factor-ily identified. lt perhaps does not refer to the burning of the ships
described ll. 659 sqq„ but to later events in the history of Sicily, perhaps her
wars with Rome.

sao-532. nec maximus, etc.: Aeneas regards the prodigy as a token of
divine favor toward Acestes, and laetum indicates the same understanding
of it on the part of Acestes himself.

533, 534. voluit — auspiciis: ‘ has made known his will by such tokens.'

534. exsortem: with te, used adverbially3 ‘apart from the lot,' ‘ont of
due course '3 i.e. he drew a prize not provided for among the premiums first
proposed.

537. in magno munere: ‘ as a noble gift.'

538. Ferre: see note on 1, 66. -sui monumentum= ‘as a memento of
himself)

displeased that an extraordinary gift, eclipsing the first prize, should be pre·
sented to Acestes. ,

543. Proximus ingreditur donis: ‘he advances next in gifts’3 i.e. next in
receiving a prize.

545-603. The cavalry exercise (cursus equorum) of Ascanius and his
young companions is introduced in addition to the regular contestS, and as a
pleasing surprise to the spectators. Three leaders (ductores, magistri), Pri·

U amus, Atys, and Ascanius, command each a troop of twelve boys. They
engage in complicated evolutions, compared by the poet to the Labyrinth of
Daedalus, and are nearly through with the exercise, when they are suddenly
interrupted by the news that the ships are on fite.

The martial game os the boys, here described, was called Troia, and was
practiced by the Romans, especially in the time of Virgil, under the patron·

age os Augustus,

545. nondum—misso: ‘when the contest (of the archers) had not yet
been ended.’ Epytides had been called while the game os archery was still
going on, that the troop os boys might be prepared to appear without delay.
