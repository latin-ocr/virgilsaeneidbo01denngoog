N 26 VIRGIL’S AENEID

363. auro: H. 477, 113 LM. 645 ; A. 248, c; B. 218, 83 G. 4053 (H. 421,
111, N. 1).

364. Pygmalionis opes: not actually the treasures of Pygmalion, but
wealth which he had expected to secure by murdering Sychaeus·

3⁶5· locos: see note on 1. 2. cernis: is used with the same freedom as
vides, above, l. 338: ‘ you have before you‚’ ‘can see.'

367. Byrsam: the citadel of Carthage was so called, according to the
Greeks whose explanation Virgil follows, from βύρσα, ‘a hide'; because the
colonists cut a bull's hide into strips and thus managed to inclose a large
tract of land for the Acropolis of their new settlement. The real meaning
of byrsa, however, which is a corruption os the Phoenician word bosra, seems
to be ‘ citadel.'

372. dea: Aeneas feels that she is something more than a simple huntreSS,
notwithstanding her disavowal. pergam and vacet (‘ were Ῑ to go on,'
¹ were there leisure ') ε would regularly be followed by the present subjunctive
in the apodosis3 but the indicative, componet, is substituted to express the
absolute certainty of the conclusion in the mind of the speaker.

374. Ante: ‘before ' Ῑ should conclude. Vesper: the god of evening.
He is represented by the evening star, and his office is to close the portals of
the sky, or Olympus, when the sun with his chariot has entered in; and thus,
as it were, he puts the day to rest (componere).

376. Troiae: H. 440,4; LM. 5693 A. 214,s; B. 2023 G. 3613 (H. 396,
