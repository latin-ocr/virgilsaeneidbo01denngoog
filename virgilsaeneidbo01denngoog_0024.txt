20 INTRODUCTION

Augustus Caesar and his adoptive father, Julius Caesar, claimed
descent through the Julian gens from IuluS, AeneaS, and the god-
dess Venus, The real purpose of the Aeneid, as a national cpio,
was the glorification of Augustus and the culmination of events
under his wise and beneficent rule. This could be done in no
better or more effective way than by depicting the wanderings
of his Trojan ancestor to the Western Land, multum ille et terrtls·
iactatus et alt0,· by representing the Olympian gods as taking an
active interest in his fortunes 3 and by Setting forth the shaping
of events preparatory to the establishment of universal Roman
dominion during the administration of Augustus, imperium Oceano
famam qui terminet astrtk.

In selecting the story of AeneaS, Virgil thus united all the quali·
ties necessary for a successful Roman epic. The character of the
hero possessed interest in belonging to the distant, legendary
period of the Trojan war, yet satisfied the national sentiment in
being closely connected with Roman fortunes of the day, and
this latter was the more important condition to meet. ‘The real
keynote to the poem is not the “arma virumque '' with which it
opem, but the “Tantae molis erat Romanam condere gentem '’ with
which the exordium closes! The expansion of this subject also
gave an opportunity of magnifying the names of Romans great in
national history. This is done in the scene in Hades, described·
in Book VI, where Anchises points out to Aeneas the souls that are
to return to the upper world and become distinguished Romans of
future generations. At the same time the Aeneid is conceived
upon a large scale, covering as it does the history of the establish-
ment of Roman greatness‚ and, partly by way ofintimation‚ os all suc-
ceeding eventS, culminating with the rule of the Emperor Augustus,

In two ways the Aeneid differs from its Greek modeIS. In the
first place it belongs to the type of the literar-y epiC, in distinction
from the Iliad and Odyssey, which belong to the class of primitive
epiCS. The latter are the spontaneous narration of early legends
and traditions. They are characterized by a charming natural-
ness of manner and language, by vividneSS‚ and a lively imagina-
