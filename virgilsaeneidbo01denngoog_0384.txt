N 32 VIRGIL’S AENmn

466-493. The poet seems to have in mind a series of eight pictureS, which
we must imagine to be painted under the portico on the outer wall of the
temple: (1) the victory of the Trojans under Hector3 (2) the victory of the
Greeks under Achilles; (3) the death of Rhesus; (4) the death of Troilus:
(5) the Trojan matrons before the statue of Minerva ; (6) Priam as a suppli·
ant before Achilles; (7) Memnon in battle; and (8) the battle of the Ama-
zons with the Greeks.

467, 468. Hac (sc. parte) τ ‘here,’ ‘in this part ’3 i.e. on this panel · ‘ Here
the Greeks were flying, (while) the Trojan youth pursued3 here (on the next
‚panel) the Trojans (were flying, while) the crested Achilles in his chariot
pressed on.' curru: an ablative of the instrument.

469. Nec procul hinc: ‘and not far hence'3 from that part of the series
of paintings mentioned in the preceding verses. Rhesi: ‘ Rhesus,' a Thracian
prince, who hadcome to the aid of Priam‚ and encamped on the night of his
arrival outside of the city'. According to some post-Homeric accounts„ it was
fated that Troy should not fall unless the horses of Rhesus should come into
the possession of the Greeks before they had tasted of the pasturage of Troy
and drunk of the river Xanthus. In the Iliad, X, 433, Ulysses and Diomedes
penetrate into the camp of Rhesm, slay the chief himself and twelve of his
followerS‚ and convey the horses to the Grecian camp. niveis velis: ‘with
snowy coverings’3 ablative of description. Virgil is thinking of his own
timeS. Huts of twigs and turf were used in the heroic age. ”

47ο. primo prodita somno: ‘betrayed in their first (and therefore sound-
est) sleep.' Others understand by ‘first sleep’ the sleep of the first night of
their arrival.

471. vastabat: ‘was (just before) devastating.’ He was not represented
in the painting as actually engaged in slaughter, but the bodies of- the slaha,
scattered around in the picture, suggest this idea. multa caedet better
with vastabat than cruentw. ⁸

472. avertit: ‘is leading away,’ ‘driving away! This is the immediate
subject, or, so to speak‚ the action of the picture.

473. gustassent: the pluperfect is used here after an historical present.
For the mood, see H. 605, 23 LM. 88o; A. 327 ; B. 2923 G. 5773 '(H. 520, 11).

474. Troilus: the youngest son of Priam.

475. atque: connects infelix and impar. Achilli: limits congressus.

476. curru: see note on l. 226. resupinus: ‘thrown backward.’ The war
chariot was very short and low, and open behind. Two warriors usually rode
together, one to fight and the other to drive. The chariot in this case is empty,
because Troilus is thrown out, and the charioteer, perhaps, has been slain.

477. tamen: ‘yet (though he has been thrown out of the chariot).'

478. versa hasta: ‘with his inverted spear,' which being held in the right
hand, and thrown backward over his shoulder, trails in the dust as he is
