290-505. Aeneas sails again to the northward, and lands at PelodeS‚ the
seaport of Buthrotum, in Epirus. At Buthrotum he has an interview with
Helenus, the brother of Hector, and Andromache, formerly the wife of Hec-
tor, and more recently the slave of Pyrrhus, but now the wife of Helenus».
By a wonderful combination of events, Helenus and Andromache have come
to be the rulers of Chaonia, a district in Epirus. Just before parting with
Aeneas, Helenus, who is a priest and prophet, gives him instructions about
his future course: informing him that his new kingdom is to be planted, not
on the nearest (or Adriatic) shore of Italy, but on the farthest (or Tyrrhe·
nian) shore; that he must pass round the peninsula, shunning the new Greek
colonies established by Idomeneus, the Locri, and Philoctetes; that he must
not enter the straits of Scylla and Charybdis, but sail round Sicily by the
south, and enter the Tuscan Sea from Drepanum; that he must seek an
interview with the prophetess or Sibyl at Cumae, who will give him direc-
tions for his future guidance.
