¹72. Quarum quae, etc.: ‘and Deiopea, who (is) the sairest of these in
beauty‚ 1 will unite to you in lasting wedlock, and pronounce your own!
The nominative, Deiopea, is put by attraction in the case of the relative quae,
instead of the accusative, which would have been the regular construction.
H. 399, 33 A. 200, b3 B. 251, 43 G. 6163 (H. 445, 9). Quarum is trans-
lated as if earumque. The preference for the relative in Latin often gives
rise to the construction, which we have here, of two relatives in the same
sentence3 cf. the frequently recurring expression in Cicero, quae cum ita sint.
The genitive is governed by the superlative, pulcherrima, as a genitive of the
whole. See note on 1. 96.

73. conubio: is scanned as a trisyll. H. 733, 3, N. 43 LM. 11123 A. 347,
c; B. 367, 1‚; G. 7233 (H. 608, 111,-N. 2). propriam: is a strong word,
denoting sure and perpetual possession.

75. pulchra prole: seems to modify faciat in the same way as is the
expression were enixa pugcltram prolem ,· ‘that she may make thee a parent,
having borne to thee (by bearing to thee) a fair offspring.’ Thus it is an
ablative of meanS. ·

76. haec: supply ait or dicit. See H. 388, 5 ; LM. 4613 A. 206, c; Β.
166, 33 G. 6883 (H. 368, 3). Tuus—labor: ‘it is thy task to consider

 

 

what thou desirest ’3 i.e. I have not the responsibility os deciding whether ¹

that be right or wrong which you wish.

77. Explorate: to look into the nature os the request. Aeolus will excuse
himself, when called to account for trespassing on the dominion of Neptune,
by pleading the command of Jun0, and his duty to her.

78. Tu mihi: in ascribing to Juno's intercession with Jupiter the power
and dignity conferred upon Aeolus, Virgil has probably followed some ancient
myth, in which Juno, as the impersonation of the air, was represented as exer-
cising some influence over the winds and in the creation of a king under
whose control they were placed. quodcumque hoc regni (est) ε ‘this domin·
ion, such as it is! sceptra: as above, l. 57, and below, l. 253, indicates
the kingly power with sornewhat more fullness than the singular number.
For the case of epulis, see H. 4293 LM. 53²3 A. 2283 B. 187, 1113 G. 3473
(H. 386).

79. accumbere: the infinitive with dare, as in l. 66.

80. Nimborume H. 451, 23 LM. 5733 A. 218, a; B. 204, 13 G. 3743 (H.

399, 1, 3)-

81-123. The storm3 the despair of Aeneas, the loss os one ship, and extreme
peril of his whole fleet.

81. conversa cuspide: ‘with his shisted spear '; not with the point turned
downward, but turned from a vertical to a horizonta] position. While still
seated, Aeolus strikes the point of the spear, which he had ,previously held as
