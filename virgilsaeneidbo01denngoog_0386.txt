N 34 VIRGIL'S AENEID

493. Bellatrix: ‘a warlike heroine'3 in apposition with Penthesilea. Ob-
serve the emphasis given to this appellative by its position in the verse, like
venatrix, l. 319. audetque, etc-t ‘and (though)
a virgin‚' etc. Fig. 8, copied from a statue in
the Vatican‚ represents an Amazon in the Greek
style. The hals-moon shield is seen at her side.
An Amazon in the Phrygian costume is repre-
sented in vase paintings.

friendly reply‚ and apologizes for the harsh con·
duct of her subjects. She offers to give them the desired aid, or to receive
them as subiects into her new state. While she is expressing the wish that
Aeneas himself were present, and her determination to send messengers
everywhere in search of him, the cloud which enveloped him is suddenly
dispelled, and he thus appears unexpectedly in the presence of the Queen
and his Trojan friends,
