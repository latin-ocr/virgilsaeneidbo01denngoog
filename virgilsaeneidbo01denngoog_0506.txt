Ν 154 ‘ VIRGIL’S Asnam

604-699. The burning of the ships. While the games are in progresn
Juno sends Iris down to excite discontent among the Τ rojan women, who are
assembled near the shore, not witnessing the gameS, but gazing mournfully on
the sea, while they bemoan the death os Anchises. While they are grieving
that so much of the sea is still to be crossed, and that they cannot put an end
to their hardships by settling in Sicily, Iris presents herself in the form of
Beroe, a Trojan matron, and gives utterance to the feelings which fill them
all. They are roused to fury, and, seizing firebrands from the altars of Nep-
tune, on which sacrifices are burning near the water, they hurl them into the
ships, Presently the alarm is conveyed by Eumelus to the Trojan assembly at
the tomb of Anchises. Ascanius, having scarcely completed the cavalry exer-
cise, hastens on his horse, followed by Aeneas and the rest, to extinguish the
fire. But it has already penetrated into the holds of the ships, and all human
efforts are unavailing. Aeneas then calls upon Jupiter, who answers his
prayer by sending down a flood of rain, and preserving all the ships save four. -
