455. obscenum: ‘ill boding.’ Cf. ΙΙΙ, 262.

456. visum: used substantively; ‘ appearance!

457. in tectis: ‘within her palace.’ In the open court of the palace
there was a memorial temple dedicated to the Manes of Sychaeus, Dido’s
coniunx antiquus.

459. Velleribus niveis: ‘with snowy woolen bands (fillets).' See note
on 1, 417.

462. bubo: feminine only in Virgil. It was a bird of ill omen, and when-
ever it appeared in Rome an expiatory sacrifice was made. culminibus z
‘ on the (palace) roofs.’ Tennyson is indebted to VirgiI, in Lancelot and
Elaine, in the following lines (992 sqq.) z —

⁸ Death like a friend's voice from a distant field
Approaching through the darkness. called3 the owls
Wailing had power upon her.'

464. piorum: ‘holy.’

467, 468. semper—terra: an impressive foreshadowing of death. viam:
H· 4093 LM· 5043 Α· 2383 B· 176, 43 G· 3332 2; (H0 37¹2 ῙῙ)· ’

469-473. Her mind is filled with diseased fancies; she is like Pentheus,
who was driven mad by the Furies (the Eumenides, or Dirae) because he
opposed the introduction of the Bacchanalian rites into his kingdom of
Thebes; or, like Orestes, also represented on the stage (scaenis) as pursued
(agitatus) by the Furies, In the Bacchae of Euripides, l. 918, which virgil
may have in mind, Pentheus says, ‘ 1 seem to see two suns, and Thebes, and
the seven-gated city double.' In the Eumenides of Aeschylus, Orestes, fleeing
from the avenging shade of Clytemnestra‚ and from the Furies (cf. ΙΙΙ, 331),
seeks refuge in the temple of Apollo at Delphi. The Furies follow to the
door of the sanctuary, which they are afraid to invade, and therefore sit,
guarding the entrance (sedent in limine Dirae).

474-552. Dido makes preparation for her suicide by causing a funeral pyre
to be erected in the court of the palace, ostensibly for the purpose of buming
an image of Aenea, and the arms and clothing left by him; which ceremony,
she assures Anna, will magically work the cure of her love for AeneaS, or else
restore him to her affectionS. A sorceress from the Hesperides has given her
instructions to perform the ceremony, with the promise of such a result3 and
Dido causes Anna to believe that she intends nothing more than to go
through with these magic rites, In the night, when by herself, she gives
utterance to her bitter anguish.

475. secum: ‘with herself (alone) ’ς without the knowledge of Anna, ot
any confidant. modumz the mode of accomplishing her death.
