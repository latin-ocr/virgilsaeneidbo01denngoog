N 22 vmcms ΑΕΝΕΗ)

in B.C. 29 and 25. The image of war, conceived of as a Fury‚ chained within,

an instance of hendiadys (see note on l. 61) for ferreis compagibus artae.

and Antony.

by so influencing the minds of the Carthaginians and their queen, that when
the Trojans shall present themselves, their reception will be friendly. ponunt ε

305-417. On the following morning Aeneas walks forth, attended by
Achates alone, to explore the neighboring country. In the forest heis met

She directs him to continue his walk until he shall reach the new city of Car-
thage‚ where he will meet with a kind reception‚ and she assures him of the
safety of the twelve missing ships. She then reveals herself in her real form
just as she is vanishing from his sight. Aeneas pursues his way, protected
by his mother, who renders him and his companion invisible by surrounding
them with a thick mantle of cloud.

much throughout the night, when the genial light first dawned, resolved
te gc forth,’ etc.
