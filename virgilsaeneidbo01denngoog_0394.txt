as in ΙΙ, 577.

sovereigns, but by other persons of rank.

659. donis: join with incendat ‚· ‘that he may with (aided by) the gists
inflame the queen to madneSS.’ Furentem is proleptic. See note on 1. 637.
Cupid is conceived as exercising his own power, while aided also by the

ι princely gifts of Aeneas; for these awaken kind feelings in Dido. Cf. l. 714.

660. ossibus: cf. VII, 355.

661. domum: ‘house'3 i.e. ‘race' or ‘nation,' as in l. 284. ambiguam,
bilingues: these words express the natural prejudice of virgil and the Ro·
rnanS, who employed the term Punica fides as a synonym for bad saith.

662. Urit: ‘burn3‚' ‘disturbs (her).' Supply eam. She is troubled with
the fear of Juno’s enmity and her skill in mischief. cura recursat: the
anxiety of Venus about Aeneas had been relieved by the promises of Jupiter
(see ll. 257 sqq.); but now, as the banquet hour approaches at nightfall (sub
noctem), she thinks of the new perils of the TrojanS, and her sear returns.
There may be an allusion to the fact that night is apt to bring back and

magnify the anxieties of the mind.
