Ille ego, qui qnondam gracili modulatus avena
Carmen, et egressus silvis. vicina co’egi
Ut quamvis avido parerent arva colono,
Gratum opus agricolis .· at nunc horrentia Martis.

THE above verses are usually placed, in the editions of virgil, at the begin·
ning of the Aeneid, but printed in a form different from that of the text, as an
indication that there is a question as to their authenticity, and as to their
proper connection with the poem. They were known to ServiuS, the great
commentator on virgil, and seem not unworthy of the poet. But, on the
other hand, the lines are not found in the best manuscripts, while “ ali·
antiqnity,'' as Ribbeck says, “ recognizes the words arma virumque as the
beginning of the poem.’' They were thus understood by Propertius and
quoted by Ovid‚ contemporaries practically of the poet, and by the later
writers, Martial and Persius. It is possible that these four lines were prefixed
by the poet to one or more copies of the first book presented to personal
friends. At any rate, although they may be Virgilian, they should not form
part of the text.

¹ Trans.= ⁶ I, that poet who formerly tuned my song with the slender pipe,
and (then) coming forth from the wood (i.e. dismissing sylvan or pastoral
themes) taught the neighboring fields to fulfill the desire of the husbandmen,
however greedy (i.e. made his labors fruitful through the teaehings of my
poems on husbandry), a work (of song) acceptable to the tillers of the soilz
yet now sing the bristling arms of Mars!

ego: sc. cano.
vicina: ‘ neighboring,’ near by the woods, implying that the subjecta of the
Bucolica and Georgics are nearly related.
horrentia: the idea of ⁴ terrible ' or ⁴ dreadful ’ is occastoually associated, as
perhaps here, with the literal meaning of horrens·
