tion. The literary epic, of which the Aeneid is the representative,
is the product of a different and a later epoch in civilization3 it
is less spontaneous and so more artificial. It presupposes a long
development in the literary history of a people, and implies on
the part of the poet extraordinary powers of arranging and com-
bining masses of material.

In the second place, the Aeneid is, as we have seen, a national
epiC, while the Iliad and Odyssey are epics of human life. But
Virgil’s poem is not by any means devoid of soenes of human

The characters in this epic drama play their part well. Aeneas is

ordinary human impulses. The strength required in such an
instrument is the strength of saith, submission, patience, and
endurance; and it is with this strength that Aeneas encounters
the many dangers and vicissitudes to which he is exposed, and
withdraws from the allurements of ease and pleasure.' Cf. notes
on I, 10, 220.

Besides Aeneas the characters that stand out most prominently
are Dido and Turnus, the former dominating the first half of the
poem, the latter the last half. The character of the ill-fated queen
Dido is strong. Hers was a generous and trusting‚ but pure and
noble soul. Her succumbing to the fatal passion was brought
about by divine agency. The queen's real nature is exhibited
