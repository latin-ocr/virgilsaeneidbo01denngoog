131. Tenent omnia, etc.: ‘woods occupy all the intervening space'3 i.e.

More strictly, they are branches of one great stream. See note on l. 295.
Cf. Milton’s description of the rivers of the lower world (Par. Lost, 2, 577) :—

⁴Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;
Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;
CocytuS‚ named of lamentation loud
Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegethon,
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
Far off from these a slow and silent stream,
Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls
Her watery labyrinth; whereof who drinks
Forthwith his former state and being forgets,
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.¹
