BOOK II

Aeneas recounts to Dido the captui-e and sack of Troy.

1-249. After a brief introduction‚ Aeneas enters upon his narrative, which
begins with the story of the wooden horse. The GreekS, now in the tenth
year of the siege, disheartened by their ill succeSS‚ resort to stratagem. On
the night which precedes the burning of the city, they pretend to have aban-
doned the siege, and to have taken ship for Greece; they leave upon the
plain, before the walls of Troy, an immense fabric of wood, made to resemble
a horse, and of such size that it can be carried into the city only by enlarging
the gate or breaking down a portion of the wall. .

Within this fabric are concealed many of the Grecian chiefs, while the army,
under the command of Agamemnon, instead of continuing the voyage, lies
hidden beyond the island of Tenedos, a few miles from Troy.

The Trojan multitude issues from the gates, and, gathering round the strange
image, hesitate whether to convey it into the city or to destroy it.

At this moment the cunning Sinon, who has purposely suffered himself to
be made prisoner, is brought before King Priam‚ and by his artful story gains
the confidence of the king, and leads him and his people to believe that the
wooden horse, once placed within the citadel‚ will become, like the Palla·
dium, the safeguard of Troy. The device of Sinon and the Greeks is aided
by Minerva, who sends two serpents to slay the priest Laocoon for attempting
to destroy the image consecrated to her. This prodigy confirms the Trojans

in the purpose already formed, and by means of ropes and rollers they convey
the wooden horse through the city up to the citadel.
