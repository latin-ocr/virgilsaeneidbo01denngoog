696. The story was that the nymph Arethusa was loved by the river god
Alpheus, When he pursued her, she was changed by Artemis into a stream
that flowed beneath the sea to Ortygia. The god continued to pursue sier,
and his waters were mingled with hers in the fountain which bears her name.

698. Exsupero: for praetervehor ,· ‘ I sail by.' Helori: the river Helorus
runs into the sea a little above the promontory of Pachynum with a very
gentle current, which is sometimes even rendered stationary by the easterly
wind, so that the neighboring lands are overflowed and fertilized.

701. Camarina: not the city itsels, but a lake near the city, was forbidden by
the oracle of Apollo to be removed. When the inhabitants, on account of pes-
tilence, caused the lake, in spite of the oracle, to be drained, the city was thus
exposed to its enemieS‚ who passed over the bed of the lake and captured it.

702. Immanis: ‘impetuous‚' to be taken with Gela. Gela= takes the long
