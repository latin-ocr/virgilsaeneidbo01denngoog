2. Euboicis—oriae Cumae, a city situated on the coast of Campania, a
little north of NapleS, was founded in very ancient times by a colony from
Cyme, in Asia Minor, and
from Chalcis», in Euboea.
Hence the terms Euboean
and Chalcidian are applied

the Acropolis, on which stood
the temple of Apollo, are very
many subterranean passages·
