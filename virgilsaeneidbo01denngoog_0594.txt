N 242 VIRGIL'S AEN EID

774, 775. Voveo, etc.= ‘1 consecrate thee thyself, Lausus, as a trophy of
Aeneas, covered with the spoils torn from the body of the robber.’ Lausus
was thus to be, as it were, a living trophy. A trophy, in the proper sense of
the word, was the trunk of a tree erected and covered with the arms of the
slain. See XI, 5 sqq„ and F ig. 77.

‘No translation — much less comment —can adequately render the pathetic
beauty of this passage, with its powerful picture of ¹the sudden revulsion of
feeling in Aeneas from wrath to pity at the death os young Lausus in defense
of a father? (Papillon.)

833-908. Mezentius, meanwhile, having retreated to the bank of the river,
soon hears the tidings of his son’s death. No longer able to fight on foot, he

returns to the field mounted on his horse, and, again encountering Aeneas, is
slain.
