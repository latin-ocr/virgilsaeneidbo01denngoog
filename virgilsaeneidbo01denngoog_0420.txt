438—558. Aeneas is now attracted by the noise of the combatants to the
palace of Priam. On reaching the palace‚ he finds the great body of the
GreekS, led on by PyrrhuS, making a furious assault on the front. He effects

defenders in hurling down missiles and masses of the building material on
the assailants. From the roos he sees the Greeks under Pyrrhus finally burst

rhus slay Polites, a son of Priam, at the feet of his father, and Priam himself,
after a feeble resistance‚ near the family altar.
