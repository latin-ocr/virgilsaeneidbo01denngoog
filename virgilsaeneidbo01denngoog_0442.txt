Ν 90 VIRGIL’S AEN EID

121-191. Aeneas lands in Crete without opposition, as King Idomeneus
has fled from the country. His new settlement is soon visited with plagae
and famine, and the Penates declare to him in a vision that the Delian oracle
referred not to Crete, but to Hesperia or Italy. Anchises recalls the tradi·
tion of the twofold origin of the Trojans (Teucer from Crete, and Dardanus
from Italy), and advises him to set sail for Hesperia.

122. Idomeneus accusative of the Greek declension (Ἰδομενῆα). Idome-
neus was one of the most distinguished of the Grecian chiefs at the siege of
Troy. In fulfillment of a vow made during a tempest, to sacrifice to the gods
the first object which should meet him on landing in Crete, he was compelled
to make his own son, Merion, the victim. A pestilence which befell the
people soon afterwards being attributed to this act, Idomeneus was expelled
from his country, and, therefore, planted a new dominion in the Sallentine
district of Southern Italy. See below, l. 400, and XI, 264 sq.
