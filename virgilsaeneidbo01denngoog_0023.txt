sentiment 3 it was expected to revive and perpetuate great events
in Roman history, and so transmit them to posterity. The Roman,
then, in contrast with the Greek, chose to portray in poetical
form actual historical events, past, or even contemporary, history
that bore witness to the greatness of the nation. Secondly‚ it was,
a Roman instinct to honor great individuals, men who achieved
success in arms in the interest of the Roman state. Accordingly
the Roman singled out foremost leaders whom he glorified and
whose name he perpetuated. This tendency also the Roman
epic poet had to respect. A third characteristic of the Romans

Greek conception was ideal, whereas the Roman was practical.
Keeping in mind these three motives which tended to influence
every Roman composition, it is not difficult for us to discover how
Virgil came to choose the story of Aeneas as the subject of his epic.
The charming narration of events in the Homeric poems had
affected Roman as well as Greek, and many a dramatic action in
both languages took for its subJect one of these heroic legentis,
Now the story of Aeneas, in the later developed form in which
virgil found it, is the only one of national significance that is
connected with the events os the Trojan war. The selection of
the story of Aeneas was further influenced by the fact that
