Ν 190 VIRGIL’S AENEID

729. mamerco nub aequore: ‘ beneath its smooth surface ’ς like polished
marble.

73ο. ollis Seminibus: ‘to these seeds ' of being; these sparks from the all·
pervading fite, or principle of vitality and thought.

731. quantum: this ethereal force manifests itself especially in man, ‘so far
as ’ the baneful influences of the animal passions do not impede its working.

733. Ηίιιοε ‘ hence ' ; by reason of this, i.e. from the debasing union of the
body with the soal, implied in the preceding clause. Fear, desire, grief, and
joy were all regarded, especially by the Stoics, as weak affections contracted
by the soul from the body. aurant here, ‘the pure aii-'3 the upper region
of the heavens (caelum) from which they sprung.

734. clausae: sc. animae.

737. penitus: join with inolescere. que ε ‘and indeed.'

738. Multa diu concreta: ‘many impurities long accumulating’ 3 waxing
with the body in growth. inolesceret sc. illis (= animis). . miris modis:
⁶ in wondrous wize: ‘strangely.' Cf. 1, 354

740-742. The punishments inflicted for the purification of souls are varied
according to the nature and degree of the guilt contracted in life.. Exposure
to the winds suffices for one class ; others must be purged beneath a great gulf
of water, while the deepest infection is purged by fite.

742. Infectam scelus: ‘the contracted guilt.’

743. Quisque—Maneat ‘ we suffer each his peculiar punishments.’ Manes
signifies: (1) the shades os the dead3 (2) Hades, or the abode of the shades3
(3) avenging powers of the lower world; (4) penalties inflicted by these
powers. It seems to be used here in the last sense. The idea of the whole
passage (11. 743-751) seems to be this: we are all punished for actual sin
with penalties more or less severe, which require more or less time, accord-
ing to the degree of the moral infection. Thereupon (after punishment)
we are admitted to vast Elysium, and a few of us, wh0, by the special
favor of the gods, are not destined to go again into other bodies, like these
great multitudes (see ll. 713sqq.), but are permitted to retain our identity,
occupy these blissful fields until we are free from the very last traces of inbred
impurity (Concretam labem), We thus become once more unmixed, ethereal,
fiery essenee, as at the first. But all these, to whom earthly bodies are again
allotted by fate, are conducted aster the lapse of a thousand years to the bor-
ders of Lethe, and prepared by its oblivious waters to enter upon that new
existence. Anchises, and such as he (pauci), who were already deified in
the minds of their descendants, are represented as not subject to the fate os
the great multitude of shades destined to be transformed into other mem
i.e. Anchises must continue to exist as Anchises until his soul resumes its orig-
inal condition as a part os the universal soul. Hence there is a marked con·
trast intended between pauci and Has omnes.
