362-484. The pugilistic contest is next described. DareS, a Trojan, pre·

him. Then an old Sicilian of Trojan descent, Entellus, is induced by his
friend Acestes to enter the lists. They put on the gauntlets furnished by
Aeneas, and begin the fight. Entellus at first stands on the defensive‚ and
merely patries or avoids the blows of his more nimble antagonist. At last

’ the old man aims a blow with immense effort at DareS, who adroitly turns
