Rhythm in English verse depends upon the strong word stress
'which prevails in this language 3 it results from the collocation of
words in such a manner as to produce a regularly recurring
accent. In the Latin language, on the other hand, the accent of
the individual word was very slight. In poetry, therefore, there
was another basis for metrical rhythm, namely, the regular recur-
rence of long and short syllables.¹ In this respect, both in prose
and poetry, Latin differs radically from English, namely, in its
practice of giving more time (theoretically twice as much) to the
pronunciation of certain vowels than it does to others. The
English language is accentual, the Latin is quantitative.

Since the quantitative character is as truly present in prose as
in poetry, it follows that if one read Latin poetry as he should
read Latin prose, that is, with a proper observance, in his pro·
nunciation, of long and short syllables,² the metrical flow would
be apparent without any further effort on the part of the reader.
But since our own language has an entirely different basis for its
verse, it is at first difficult to read Latin poetry quantitatively.
Only abundant practice will make it easy and enjoyable.

Very often a lack os perfect familiarity with the length of root
vowels is a hindrance to the reader. The student should first of
all know fairly well the quantity of final syllableS. He will get
information on this in his grammars (H. 691 fol. 3 LM. 1096 fol. ς

Poetry, Boston, 1899: What was Ictus in Latin Prosody ἲ American Journal os

2 Pupils should car-efully distinguish between a long vowel and a long syllable.
A long syllable rnay be one (1) which contains a long vowel followed by a single
consonant, or (2) which contains a long vowel followed by two or more conso-
naum, or (3) even one which contains a short vowel is followed by two or more
consonants. Thus tempore is just as much a dactyl as flimine.
