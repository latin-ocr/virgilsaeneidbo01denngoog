Turnus, in his haste, having armed himself with the sword of his charioteer
instead of his own, is now deceived by the treacherous weapon, which breaks
at the first blow. He is pursued by Aeneas round and round, though the
latter is retarded by his wound. While Aeneas in vain struggles to release his
spear from the root of a tree into which it had struck, Juturna‚ in the guise of
Metiscus, brings to Turnus his own sword. Then Venus, indignant at the
interference of the nymph, loosens the spear of Aeneas from the root, and the

battle is renewed.

death, and which weight (whether that which represents Aeneas or that which -

791—886. Jupiter forbids Juno to exercise any further influence in the con-
test, but consents, in answer to her prayer, that the Trojans shall lose their
name, and that the Latins shall give theirs to the united people. One of the
furies is sent in the form of a bird of ill omen to terrify Turnus3 aud Juturna,

giving up all hope, plunges into the Tiber.
