N 196 · v1RG1L’s AENEn)

Gracchus, who lost their lives in their vain struggle to ameliorate the condi·
tion of the plebeian order at Rome.

843. Scipiadas: Scipio Africanus Major, who closed the Second Punic
war by defeating Hannibal at Zama, and Scipio Africanus Minor, who cap-
tured and destroyed Carthage in the third Punic war. Note the form used in
hexameter verse. The genitive Scipidn'is would not fit in the meter. parvo
potentem: ‘ rich in poverty'; having all the advantages of wealth by living
contented with a little. Fabricius», though poor, was wholly uninfluenced by
the bribes offered by Pyrrhus.

844. Serrano: Gaius Atilius ReguluS, consul in B.C. 257, said to have
been surnamed SerranuS, because when his election was announced he was
found cultivating his land, or ‘ planting in the furrow.’ He was also con·
sul in B.C. 250, the year when his still more celebrated namesake came
from Carthage on his mission to the Roman senate for the exchange of
prisoners.

845. Maximus: this was an appellation of many of the Fabii. The one
here referred to retrieved the fortunes of Rome, after the great disaster at
Lake Trasimenna, B.C. 217, by keeping the field with a Roman army, and
avoiding any general engagement.

846. A verse borrowed from the early Roman poet, Ennius».

847. spirantia aera: ‘the breathing bronze’; life-like statues of bronze.
mollius: ‘with softer grace)

849. orabunt —melius2 Roman oratory in the time of Virgil had attained
to an excellence which might well vie with that of the Athenians3 but in this
passage the great national distinction of the Romans, their greatness as war-
riors, conquerorS, and rulers, is contrasted with those arts which characterize
the Greeks.

850. radio: the astronomer drew his diagram with a ‘rod' on wet sand
spread upon a table.

852. morem: ‘ the terms' or ‘condition8.'

854. mirantibus: Aeneas and the Sibyl were filled with wonder at the rev·
elations thus far made by Anchises,

855. Marcellus: the great Marcellus of the second Punic war, who obtained
the third spolia opima in his victory over the Cisalpine Gauls (see note on
l. 841). He was the first Roman general who gave a decided check to Han·
nibal. The mention of this great eommander leads to the following allu-
sion to his descendant, the youthful Marcellus, son of Octavia, and adopted
son of Augustus, whose untimely death caused universal grief. This occurred
in B.C. 23, while Virgil was engaged in the composition of the Aeneid.

859. Quirino: it would seem that the spolia opima, hung up in the temple
of Jupiter Feretrius, were regarded as sacred also to Quirinus,

860. una: i.e. in company with Marcellus,
