camp in their rear and ramparts inclosing them on the flanks, while the
river protects them in front. Turnus approaches them on one flank, near
the Tiber.

76—167. After invoking the MuseS‚ the poet describes the interview of Cy-
bele and Jupiter, which occurred at the time when the ships of Aeneas were
built near Phrygian Ida, when Jupiter promised that these shipS‚ after their
arrival in Italy, should be transformed into nymphs. This promise'is now ful-
filled in the sight of the Rutuli. Turum, however, nothing daunted‚ regards
the omen as favorable to his own cause, and his troops encamp for the night
on the plain.

79. Prisca fides facto, etc.: ‘ credit was given of old to the story, but its

ment from the sea.

129, 130. non—Rutulos: ‘they (the Trojans) await not for Rutulian darts
