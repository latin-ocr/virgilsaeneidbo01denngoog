1. LIFE 'AND WRITINGS OF vmcn,

Pusuus Vzacmus MARo was born at AndeS, a village near
Mantua, in the consulship of Pompey and Crassus, ac. 70. Vir-
gil's father possessed a farm at Andes sufficiently valuable to place
his family in easy circumstanceS‚ and to afford him the means of
⁴ educating his son under the most eminent teachers then living in
Italy. Τὴε education of the future poet appears to have been
commenced at Cremona, from whence, on assuming the toga
vin‘lzk, in his sixteenth year, he was transferred to the charge of
new teachers at Mediolanum (Milan).

After pursuing his studieS, probably for several yearS‚ at Medio-
lanum, he placed himself under the instruction of the Greek poet
and grammarian, PartheniuS, who was then flourishing at Naples.
At the ,age of twenty-three he left Naples for Rome, where he
finished his education under Syro the Epicurean, an accomplished
teacher of philosophy, mathematics, and physicS.

Virgil’s love of literary pursuits, as well as the delicacy of his
physical constitution, led him to choose a life of retirement rather
than that public career which was more generally deemed proper
sor a Roman citizen. Hence, at the age when aspiring young ’
Romans usually entered upon the stirring scenes of political and
military life, he withdrew from Rome to his native AndeS, with
the intention of devoting himself to agriculture, science, and let-
ters. The Sicilian Greek, Theocritus, was at this time his favorite
author, and it was from him that the general plan, though not the
individual character, of the Eelogues was derived, the first authen·
tic work produced by the poet.

The Eelogues were begun about 13.c. 42, at the request of
C. Asinius Pollio, who was then acting as the lieutenant of Antony
