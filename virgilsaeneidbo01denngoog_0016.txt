in Gaul. Pollio was himself distinguished as a poet, and not less
as a scholar, orator, and historian. Underhis patronage the sec-

. ond, third, and fifth Eclogues had already been written, when the “

literary labors and the peaceful life of the poet were suddenly
interrupted. The veteran legions of Octavian, on· returning from
Philippi, demanded the allotments of land which had been prom-
ised thern as a reward for their services in the civil war. They
were authorized to take possession of eighteen Italian cities, with
the district of country pertaining to each. The cities allotted in
this manner were those which had espoused the side of Brutus.
For this the unhappy occupants of the adjacent country were
forced to give up their hereditary estates to the rapacious soldiery.
As the lands of Cremona, which was one of the condemned cities,

After the close of the Perusian war, the Mantuan country was
again disturbed by the demands of the veteranS, and the poet in
· vain attempted, though at the risk of his life, to maintain his rights
against the centurion Arrius, F leeing again for succor to Octavian,
he was reinstated in the possession of his farm, though not without
long and anxious delay. During this period of delay and depressa
‚ing uncertainty, in the autumn of 13.c. 41, he wrote the ninth
Eclogue, in which he bewails his unhappy lot. But on obtaining
at length the object of his petition, his joy and gratitude found
utterance in the beautiful hymn called the fourth Eclogue, in
