genial spirits, filled with the most lively admiration of each other,
laboring side by side, both striving earnestly for the same object-
it was reserved for Virgil and Horace to elevate the national poetry
to a character worthy of Rome, to develop all the resources of their
noble language, and to make it flow in both heroic and lyric verse
with all the grace and dignity that had hitherto been characteristic
of the Greek alone. ,

After the publication of the EclogueS, Virgil appears to have
passed the remainder of his life chiefly at Naples. His feeble
health was probably the occasion of this.

It was here that he composed the GeorgicS, a didactic poem in
four bookS, in which he endeavors to recall the Italians to their
primitive but long-neglected pursuit of agriculture. In point of
versification this is the most finished of the works of the poet, and,
indeed, as Addison remarkS, it may be regarded as in this respect
the most perfect of all poems. In the first book he treats of the
management of fields, in the second of treeS‚ in the third of horses
and cattle, and in the fourth of bees. He has gathered into this
poem all the experience of the ancient Italians on these subjects,
and he has contrived to make them attractive by associating them
with wonderful beauty of diction and imagery, and with charming
variety of illustration.

Having devoted seven years, from 13.c. 37, to the writing of this
work, and conscious that his poetic labors must be ended by an
early death, he now entered upon a long-cherished plan of com-
posing an epic in the Homeric style, which should at once
commemorate the glory of Rome and of Augustus, and win back
the Romam, if possible, to the religious virtues of their progenitors.
He chose for his theme the fortunes of AeneaS, the traditional
