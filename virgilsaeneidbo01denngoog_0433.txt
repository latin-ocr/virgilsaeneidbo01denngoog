NUrEs-BOOK 11 N81

727. adverso glomerati ex agmine. crowded together in an opposing
phalanx? The ablative with ex expresses the composition of the crowd, the
material of which it is composed.

729. Suspensum: ‘anxious’ comiti. seel. 711.

731. Evasissez ‘to have passed through in safety.' Aeneas now relates
the sudden panic which the near approach of a party of Greeks occasioned,
and which led, in the confusion of the moment, to the separation of Creiisa
from the rest of the party.

735. mihi: H. 4273 LM. 5393 A. 2293 B. 188, 2,d; G. 347, R.5; (H. 385,
11, 2). nescio quod = aliquod: ‘some.’ H. 651, 2; LM. 818; A. 334, e;
B. 25 3, 6; G. 467, R. 1 ; (H. 529, 11, 5, 3)). male amicum: cf. 1. 23; IV, 8.

736. Confusam eripuit: equivalent to conficdit et eripuit. Cf. 1, 69.
cursu: cf. 1, 157. Α

737. nota regione: ‘ from the familiar direction.'

738-740. The irregular construction and arrangement are occasioned by
deep emotion. Below (l. 788), the ghost of Creiisa reveals to Aeneas that
she is in the service of the goddess Cybele, but leaves him uncertain how she
was taken away ; and this is still a mystery at the time when Aeneas is tell·
ing the story. ‘ Alas! did my wife Creiisa, torn from me, unhappy wretch!
by fate, remain behind? did she wander from the path? did she sit down
weary? (It is) uncertain.' The questions are probably direct. The first in·
terrogative, -ne, would come regularly after misero. For the case of misero,
see note on l. 735. nec connects incertum (est) and est reddita.

741. Nec amissam respexi animumve reflexi: ‘ but 1 did not look back
for the lost one, or turn my thoughts (to her).' respexi: in its literal sense.

742. Cereris: ‘the temple of Ceres.’ See l. 714. So Apollo, 111, 275.
For the omission of ad, see note on 1, 2.

744. Defuit—fefeuit: ‘she alone was missing, and was lost by her
companions,' etc.

745. amens: causal; ‘in my madness.’ -qnez is joined, in scanning, with
the following verse. See note on I, 332.

746. eversa: see note on l. 413.

747-804„ Aeneas returns through the city, and wanders everywhere in
search of Creiisa, even venturing into the midst of the Greeks, who now hold
complete possession. The shade of Creiisa appears to him, consoles his grief,
assures him of her happineSS‚ and predicts his final settlement in Italy. He
returns to his friends, who have been joined in the meantime by a multitude
of fugitives, and conducts them to Mount Ida.

748. recondo: cf. the use of occulit, 1, 312.
749. cingor: with middle sense. Cf. l. 383. Aeneas had given his weap·
ons to his attendants, while carrying his father,
