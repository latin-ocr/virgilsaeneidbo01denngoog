not merely quoted passages from Virgil, but discussed them as
well from the standpoint of the textual critic. These discussions
are exceedingly interesting, and the emendations thus upheld are
sometimes adopted by modern textual critics against the united
testimony of the manuscripts. The most important grammarians
who commentated on Virgil's poems are M. Valerius Probus (latter
part of the first century A.D.), Aelius Donatus (fourth century),
and Servius (fourth century), the most famous of the Virgilian
commentators.

V. EDITIONS AND HELPFUL BOOKS

The first printed edition of Virgil‚ the ‘editio princeps: was
published in Rome about 1469. The first edition from the Aldine
press appeared in 1501, and during the sixteenth century a large
number of editions were printed. Not until the seventeenth
century, however, do the really critical texts and commentaries
appear.

Some of the early editions are those of Ruaeus (1675, with
numerous later reprints), Heinsius (1676), Burmann (1746),
Heyne (1767-1775), the same revised and edited by Wagner
(1830-1841), Lemaire (1819—1822), and Hofmann·Peerlkamp
