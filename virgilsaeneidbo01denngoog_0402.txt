Ν 50 VIRGIL’S AENEID

37. ·que= there are two plans suggested as to the *disposition to be made
of the horse: one, to destroy it at once3 the other, to penetrate the fabric
and ascertain what there is in it. These two main propositions are separated
by aut. The first of them, however, contains two subordinate ideas as to the
method of destroying the horse: some advise casting it into the sea3 and
others, burning it. Hence the propriety of ·que‚ rather than -ve, a reading
sometimes adopted here.

4o. Primus: Laocoon was foremost, not in giving counsel, but in making
any active demonstration.

42. procul: sc. clamat. insania: sc. est ista?

43. Creditis: in vehement language the interrogative particles atrum and
ne are osten omitted.

44. carere dolis: cf. luctu, l. 26. sic notus Ulixes: you should suspect
that the craft of Ulysses is in some way connected with the wooden horse.

46. machina —lnspecturaz Virgil has in mind the siege towers οἱ a later
period, which, being rolled up to the walls of the besieged city, enabled the
assailants from the several stories and srom the summit of the tower to hurl
their missileS‚ and to pass over upon planks to the battlements of the besieged.
Thus the Greeks might have intended to use the wooden horse. For the use
of the future participle here, see H. 638, 3 3 LM. 1017, c3 A. 293, ὃς Β. 337,
4; G. 438, Νς (Η. 549, 3). Ventura desuper refers rather to the descent
of those in the machina upon the city than to the fabric itself.

47. urbi: poetical use of the dative sor in urbem.

48. aliquis: is occasionally employed, as here, in the sense of alius quis,

‘some other.'

49. Quidquid—esta see note on 1, 387. et· ‘even.’ (lona. see note on
l. 31.

51.1n latus inque—alvum. he hurled the spear with such violence that it
penetrated not only the frame‚ but even the' muer cavities os the beast. feri.
as in V, 818. compagibus: is joined with curvam (= curvatam) as an abla-
tive of means ς ‘ curving with jointed work!

52. illa: the spear.

53. gemitum: of the hollow sound given back by the wooden fabric. Cf.
111, 5553 IX, 709.

54. εἰ fata: sc. ficissent,- ‘if the fates of the gods had so willed.’ Cf.1.
433. εἰ- fuissett ‘if our minds had not been perverse’; referring to the
infatuation of the multitude.

55. Impulerat. ‘he had induced us' 3put sor the subjunctive, impulisset,
which would not so vividly have expressed the conviction of the narrator.
11. 525, 43 A. 308, b; B. 304, 33 G. 597, R. 23 (H. 476, 2).

57. Ecce: a striking incident now diverts their attention from the horse,
manus: see note on 1. 22ss
