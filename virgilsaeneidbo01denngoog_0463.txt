679. vertice: local ablative.

682—715. They leave the shores of the CyclopS, and coasting by the mouth
of the river Pantagia, the towns of Megara and ThapsuS, the bay of Syracuse,
then by the river Helorus and the promontory of Pachynum, they sail west-
erly by Camarina, Gela, Mount Acragas, or Agrigentum, and doubling Lily-
baeum, the western cape of Sicily, arrive at Drepanum, where they are
received by king AcesteS, and where Anchises dies.

683. ventis secundis: dative ; ‘to the guiding winds ’ς to whatever course

684-686. A perplexing passage. The sense, however, is perfectly clear.
The wind was bearing the fleet to the northward, and directly toward the
straits of Scylla and Charybdis The warning of Helenus is opposed to this
course, yet the danger from the Cyclops seems at the moment so much greater
than any other that they resolve to sail back (certum est, etc.) toward the
straits; but then suddenly a breeze is sent by a favoring divinity from the
north, and thus they escape both the perils of the straits and of the Cyclops·
The passage from Scyllam to cursus is in indirect discourse dependent upon
an ’idea of saying implied in monent ‚· hence the third person in teneant.
utramque viam: subiect of esse understood. Scyllam and Charybdim are
governed by inter. discrimine parvo: ablative of description with viam ‚-
‘with small distance <of death).’ Translate thusx .‘On the other hand, the
instructions of Helenus warn them that between Scylla and Charybdis the
path on either side is but little distant from death, if they fail to hold their
course! dare lintea tetros must be understood of their return toward the
straitS, for the wind was then in that direction.

687. angust& ⁴ narrow ’3 because Pelorus is situated on the straitS.

688. Vivo: see note on 1, 167. The Pantagia flows into the sea below
Leontini between rocky bankS. Hence its mouth is ‘ of natural rock.’

689. Thapsumt a ‘level' peninsula bounding the Megarean Gulf on the
south side.
