the body had been burned. See note on II, 644.

220. pius: ‘loyal to duty! “ His (Aeneas's) distinguishing epithet (pius)

the gods ’' (Nettleship, Lectures and Essays, p. 104). See note to 1. 10.

223-305. A scene in Olympus, Venus comes to Jupiter while he is con·
vtemplating the affairs of men, and with tears complains of the hardships of
Aeneas, who is debarred through the anger of Juno from his destined home
in Italy, in spite of his piety, and the fateS, and the promises of Jupiter, while
Antenor, another Trojan prince, has been permitted already to find a resting-
place on the shores of the Adriatic, Jupiter consoles her by reaffirming the
promise that she shall hereafter receive her son into Olympus, and that his
descendants in Italy, the Romam, shall rule the world. Mercury is then sent
down to Carthage, in order to exercise a secret influence on Queen Dido and
the CarthaginianS, that they may be prepared to give the Trojans a friendly
reception. ,
