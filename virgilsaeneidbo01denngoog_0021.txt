the Paradise Lost. The authors of these two epics are the
greatest of all plagiarist53 but the borrowed thought in both of
thern assumes so much of their individuality that their plagiarism
becomes a beauty and a virtue. They are plagiarists of the older
poets in the same sense that the painter is a plagiarist of nature.

But while the Aeneid, through the premature death of the poet,
has been left to us somewhat incomplete, and while it claims no
great degree of originality, but is largely the offspring‚ not of Vir-
gil alone, but of the genius of all antiquity, it has always been, and
always will be, justly regarded as the best and noblest of all the
poetic creations of the Roman mind, and as one of the choicest
productions of all literature. There are fashions in criticism as
well as in other things3 not, indeed, so changeful and transitory
as those of dreSS, but fashions, nevertheless3 and of late years

some scholam, even eminent scholam, have fallen into the habit
’ or affectation of speaking with some contempt of ‘the court poets
of the Augustan age! This fashion will have its day 3 but it can-
not set aside the verdict of so many generations past. Virgil and
Horace are in no danger. The Aeneid is too grand, too beauti-
ful, too pure, to be despised‚ neglected‚ or lost.

It is replete with all the qualities that are essential to a great
work of art. It is great in conception and invention. It is won-
derfully diversified in sceneS, incidents‚ and characterS‚ while it
never departs from the vital principle of unity. It is adorned with
the finest diction 'and imagery of which language is capable. In
discoursing of great achievements and great eventS, it never falls
short of the grandeur which befits the epic style 3 in passages of
grief and suffering it takes hold of our sympathies with all the
power of the most affecting tragedy. What a sublime epic of itself
is the account of the sack of Troy! what a tragedy of passion and
fate is presented in the story of Dido! Indeed, the student will
find in the Aeneid many dramatic sceneS‚ many vivid pictures of
lise and mannerS, many lively narratives of adventure, any one of

which would be of itself a poem, and would secure to its author
an enviable fame.
