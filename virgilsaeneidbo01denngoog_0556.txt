286-340. June, enraged that she can not ultimately prevent the success of
the Trojans, determines, at least for the present, to visit them with her wrath.

kindling strife between the Trojans and Latins.

of fate.

304, 305. Mars—valuit: Pirithofis, king of the Lapithae, invited all the

Mars stirred up the Centaurs to make war on the Lapithae.

305, 306. concessit Calydona Dianae: Calydon, an ancient state of Aeto·
lia, had neglected the worship of Diana, who therefore punished its king,
Oeneus, and his people, by sending a fierce wild boar to ravage their land.

people let the son-in-law and father-in·law consummate their alliance.'

320. Cisseis: ‘the daughter of Cisseus'3 Hecuba. The allusion is to the
dream of Hecuba before the birth of Paris. As she dreamed that her off-
spring would be a fite-brand, and the cause of the destruction of Troy, so has
Venus brought forth in Aeneas a like offspring (idem) —one attended with
the same destiny, who shall in like manner, by becoming betrothed to a foreign
princess, occasion disaster to the new or restored Troy (Pergama recidiva),
and thus he shall be a second PariS.

suade Latinus from his purpose, Amata conveys Lavinia to the woods, under
the pretext of celebrating the rites of Bacchus.
