320. Genu: accusative of specification with Nuda. sinus: ‘with the knee
uncovered, and the flowing folds of her dress gathered up in a knot '; accusa-
tive with a passive participle, with the reflexive force of the Greek Middle
voice3 cf. the similar construction, l. 228. The statue of Diana with the stag,
now in the gallery of the Louvre, corresponds to this description. The dress
consists of two pieceS, the tunic underneath, and the mantle over it. The
tunic is shottened by being partially drawn up underneath the girdle, and
allowed to fall over it in a sold, thus bringing the bottom of the tunic a
little above the knee. The light mantle is then folded, and knotted round
the waist. It seems to be this gathering up of the tunic and knotting of the
mantle that Virgil has in mind.
