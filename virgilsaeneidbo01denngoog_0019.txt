founder of the Julian family ; he therefore called this work, which
he divided into twelve books, the Aeneid. He had already been
employed eleven years upon his task, and had not yet put to it the
finishing hand, when he was overtaken by his last sickness. He
made a voyage to Greece, with the intention of visiting Attica and
Asia. On arriving at Athens he met AugustuS, who happened to
be at that time returning from Asia Minor to Italy. Virgil was
easily persuaded by his friend and patron to return with him imme·
diately to Rome, but he was destined never again to see the capital
city. His malady had continually increased during the voyage,
and a few days after landing at Brundisium he expired. His death
occurred in 13.c. 19. His remains were conveyed from Brundisium
to N apleS, and buried on the hill of PosilippO, in the tomb still pre·
served and revered as the ‘ tomb of Virgil!

There are no authentic portrait busts of Virgil. Outside of lit-
erary sourceS‚ our only knowledge of the personal appearance of
the poet is derived srom miniatures of some existing manuscriptS,
notably the Codex Romanus, and from two mosaicS. One of these

mosaics was discovered at Trier in 1884. The other, a represen-
tation of which is given on page 30 of this book, was found at

Susa in Tunis, in 1896.ι It is about three feet square. In the
center sits the poet, clothed in a white toga having a blue border.
His feet rest upon a footstool. He holds a partly open scroll on
which are the words ε -

‘ Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine laem,
Quidve . . . ² ²

This is sufficient to identisy the poet. On one side stands Clio,
the muse of history, reading from a roll; on the other is Melpo-
mene, muse of tragedy‚ identified as such by the tragic mask which
she holds. The mosaic dates probably from the first century ΑΔ).

The literary history of Virgil during the Middle Ages affords a
most interesting study. His fame as a poet was never dimin-
