1 8 INTRODUCI'ION

Of the preeminent worth of Virgil’s poems, and of their impor-
tance as literary studieS, the most striking proof is presented in the
fact that so many of the classics of modern poetry‚ in all cultivated
languages, have manifestly been produced under the molding and
refining influence of this great master of the art. Dante, who felt
all the power of ‘ the Mantuan: ascribes to him whatever excel·-

‘ Glory and light of all the tuneful trainl
May it avail me that Ι long with zeal
Have sought thy volume, and with love immense
Have conn'd it o'er. My master, thou, and guidel
Thou he, from whom alone Ι have derived
That style, which for its beauty into same

Exalts me.' ¹

closing events of the war3 the Odyssey describes the wanderings
of Odysseus (Ulysses) in his journey homeward.

In writing a national epic, which was to embody Roman ideas
and sentiment5‚ and which was to appeal first of all to Romans,
Virgil was compelled to conform to certain tendencies that were
likely to affect any form of narrative poetry among the Romans·
In the first place, such an epic had to satisfy a strong national
