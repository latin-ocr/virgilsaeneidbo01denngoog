the shore, leaving Gyas behind. He in his fury casts the pilot overboard, and
takes the helm himself. Meanwhile Mnestheus and Sergestus are vieing with
each other to pass the Chimaera. Sergestus at first has the advantage, but
only by a part of the ship's length, and, in his eagerness to round the goal at

strives to overtake the Scylla. But Cloanthus prays to the gods of the sea,

th'at of Mnestheus takes the second, and the Chimaera the third. Sergestus,
with difficulty, brings his ship to land.

give origin to a family which shall be called the race of Memmius (garns
