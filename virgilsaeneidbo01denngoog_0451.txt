Novas—BOOK 111 N 99

328. Lacedaemonios: Hermione was the daughter of Menelaus of Lace-
daemon, and of Helen, the daughter of Leda. Her grandparents, Tyndarus
and Leda, had promised her in marriage to Orestes, but her father gave her
to Pyrrhus· OresteS, already frantie with the consciousness of having mur-
dered his mother (scelerum Furiis agitatus), and still more maddened at the
loss of his betrothed (ereptae coniugis), came upon Pyrrhus either at Phthia,
his paternal home, or at Delphi, where he was worshiping at the altar
erected to Achilles (patrias aras), and slew him.

329. famulamque: the particle ·que is grammatically unnecessary; ‘gave
me to Helenus a slave, (being) also myself a slave.’

332. patrias: equivalent to patris.

333. Morte: ablative of time ; ‘at the death.’ -reddita: ‘being delivered
up.’

335. Troiano a Chaone: Chaon was a friend or brother of Helenus, for
whom he is said to have sacrificed his life.

336. Pergama Iliacamque arcem: the second term defines the first
by epexegesis. Cf. 1, 2: Italiam Lavinaque litora. iugis: dative with
addidit.

339. Quid: sc. agit,· ‘how fares the boy?' vescitur: cf. 1, 546.

340. Quem tibi, etc.: this is the only fragmentary verse of the Aeneid in
which an idea is not fully expressed. See note on I, 5 34. The general sense
seems to be: ‘whom Creiisa bore to thee when Troy was being besieged!

341· tamen: ‘still, (though she be no more).' The story of Creiisa's dis·
appearance at Troy may have reached Andromache during the several years
of the wanderings of Aeneas.

342. Ecquid: an emphatic indefinite interrogative particle. See H. 416,
23 LM. 507; A. 240, a; B. 176, 23 G. 333, R. 23 (H. 378, 2). Do their
deeds, and the knowledge that he is related so nearly to them, stimulate
him in any respect to noble conduct?

343. avunculus: Hector, according to one account, was the brother of
Creiisa.

345. Incassum: ‘ in vain,’ for grief can not restore the dead.

347. suos: ‘his countrymen.'

349-351. Troiam, Pergama, etc.: see note on l. 302. arentem—rivum:
‘the shallow stream with the name of Xanthus.’ For the ablative, see H.
473, 23 LM. 6433 A. ²513 Β. 2243 G. 4oo; (H. 419, 11). amplector: it
was the ancient custom to embrace and kiss the threshold, the gate, and the
doorpost, either on leaving or revisiting the ancestral roos. Cf. 11, 490.
The Trojan names bring Aeneas to his home again.

352. Teucri: after the interview between Aeneas and his friends above
described, all the Troians are summoned, and invited to share in the hospi·
talities of King Helenus
