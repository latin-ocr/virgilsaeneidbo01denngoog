the Latin race, Alba, and Rome. For the position of unde, see note on qui,
l. 1. Latinumz the aborigines and the Trojans were united under the com·
mon name of Latini.

7. altaez Rome, like many cities of Italy, was built on elevated ground,
for greater security from attack. Perhaps, however, the reference is to its
lofty walls ‘The main purpose of the Aeneid is indicated in these lines;
namely, to celebrate growth, in accordance with a divine dispensation of the
Roman empire and Roman civilization ' (Nettleship).

8-11. The invocation to the Muse.

8. quo numine laesoz ⁶ what divine purpose thwarted? ’ what interest vio-
lated? referring to Juno's favorite plan of making Carthage the mistress of
the world. For another example of numen in the sense of ‘will' or ‘purpose,’
see V, 56.

9. tot volvere casus: ‘to pass through so many vicissitudes.’ The inci-
dents of life, like time itself, are conceived as moving in a round or circle ;
hence, ‘turning’ is a metaphor signifying ‘to pass through.’ The infinitiva
here is poetic for ut volveret.

ro. pietate: embodying the predominant quality of Aeneas’s character,
emphasized throughout the Aeneid‚ ‘absolute loyalty to duty.’ See note
to l. 220.

well-known line, Par. Lost, 6, 788: —

12-33. The reply to the questions addressed above to the Muse. The
present occasion for the hostility of Juno toward Aeneas is her apprehension
for the sate of Carthage, which is destined to be overthrown by the future
Rome (12-22); besides this, she remembers the war she has just conducted
against Troy, and the causes of the resentment which occasioned that war
are still rankling in her mind3 namely (1), the origin of the Trojan race
through Dardanus from Jupiter and Electra; (2) the choiee of the Trojan
Ganymede to be cup-bearet of the gods instead of Juno's daughter, Hebe3
(3) the decision (iudicium) of the Trojan prince, Paris, by whom the golden
apple was awarded to VenuS, in preference to Juno and Minerva.

12. Urbs antiqua: Carthage was ‘ancient ’ with reference to the time of Vir·
gil, not to the time of Aeneas. Tyrii: the founders of Carthage and their de-
scendunts are termed indifferently by Virgil Phoenices, Sidonii, Poeni, or Tyrii.
