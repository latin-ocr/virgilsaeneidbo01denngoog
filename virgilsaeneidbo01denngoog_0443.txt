NOTES - BOOK 111 N 91

138. Corrupto caeli tractu: ‘the expanse of heaven being infected '3 i.e.
the region, or tract, of atmosphere pertaining to Crete.

139. satis: ‘ upon our crops '3 the same construction as membris.

140. animas: for vitas.

141. steriles: an instance of prolepsis ,· as in l. 30. exurere: historica!
infinitive. Sirius: its rising, which occurs in the hot season, was supposed
to produce drought, and sometimes pestilence. τ

143. Ortygiae: see 1. 124.

144. ire: see note on auellere, l. 134. mari: ablative absolute with re·
menso, as pelago remenso, 11, 181. The deponent has here, as often, a passive
signification. veniam precari: the favor to be asked of Apollo is a revela·
tion, informing them ‘ what end, etc.’; the clauses introduced by quam, unde,
and quo are thus dependent on the idea of responding or instructing implied
in veniam.

145. fessis rebus: cf. Ῑ, 452. ferat: like da in 1. 85, is said of Apono, as
being able to relieve them by declat-ing what the fates decree concerning
them.

147 sqq. cf. Tennyson, On a Mourner ε -

‘like a household god
Promising empire; such as those
Once heard at dead of night to greet
Troy's wandering prince, so that he 1080
With sacrifice, while all the fleet
Had rest by stony hills of Crete-⁹

terrina ablative of place where.

148. Effigies: ‘ images.’

150. visit it was a dream, as in ῙῙ, 270. iacenti& sc. mei, limiting oculos.

151, 152. se fundebat: gives more fullness of meaning than lucem fiendebat.

154. delato: ‘when thou hast sailed.’ dicturus est: ‘is on the point of
saying’3 ‘would say.’

155. ultro= ‘unasked ’ς without being first invoked. See note on ΙΙ, 145.
This condescension is in return for the piety of Aeneas in saving the images
of the Penates amidst such dangers.

156, 157. secuti, pennensi: sc. sumus.

158. -Ῑᾱοιιιε for Eidem. in astra: a phrase probably symbolica-l here, as
ad aethera, l. 462, of the glory of the descendants of Aeneas in general.

159. magnist is left indefinite, perhaps purposely. We may understand
viris, ur rebus ,· or dis, i.e. the Trojan Penates, who are speaking.

160. para: Aeneas was not actually to build the great city of Rome, but
only to prepare the way for it by founding Lavinium. See note on 11, 295.

161. Non suasite ‘did not point out.'
