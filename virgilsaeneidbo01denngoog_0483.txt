power (of vengeance) they (the authors of my woes) deserve.'

612. si: with the indicative here is an expression of her conviction that ·

so it must be; it is thus almost equivalent to quoniam. Dido upon the verge
of death is gifted with prophetie power. Her curse was fulfilled in the dan·
gers and losses which Aeneas met with in the war with TurnuS‚ wh0, with his
orave Rutulians‚ came near destroying the Trojans. Aeneas was on this occa·
sion obliged to leave Ascanius and his followers in the camp near the Tiber‚
and to seek help from Evander. He perished in the fourth year after finish-
ing the war and making a treaty with the Latin5‚ in which treaty the name of
Troian had to be sacrificed (hence pacis iniquae, l. 618). See XII, 828. He
was finally deprived of burial (the beaviest curse ot* all) because his body could

not be found.
